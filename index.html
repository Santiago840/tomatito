        <p class="card-text">
          I've been practicing sports since I was like 5 years old. I practiced
          swimming, soccer, karate and basketball. I love playing them because
          they make me feel relaxed and calm. Nowadays, I'm doing karate every
          day to become a black belt.

        <p class="card-text">
          There are lot of things that I love about animals. Any kind of animal
          is beautiful, they are so naive when you understand them. My favorite
          animal is cat because it represents me how I act in real life and I
          get a strong connection when I meet them.
